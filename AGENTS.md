## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @DOMAIN.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know
basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed
